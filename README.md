<p><b>LearnAnatomy</b> is an educational software designed for high school students. It was created for individual study as a support course for 11th grade biology.</p>

 The software has two sections for learning and testing knowledge.
</br>
<p>The learning section presents the human skeleton in 3D, with the possibility of rotation, zooming in/out, and enabling/disabling bone groups. When clicking on a bone, the student receives information about it and can view it in detail. A separate section is available for the bones of the human skull.</p>

 </br>
The knowledge testing section offers 2 mini-games and a quiz with questions.
<ul>
<li>Guess the Bone – the player receives the name of a bone and must click on the correct one. There is the possibility of viewing the correctly chosen bones and the incorrect ones.</li>
<li>Puzzle – the player must reassemble the human skull. This game aims to visualize the human skull in sections.</li>
<li>Quiz – a test of 10 random questions, with the final grade displayed at the end.</li>
A tool is also available for teachers, allowing them to generate a new file of questions to be distributed with the software.
</ul>

 The software was developed in Unity 2017.1.2f1 and entirely written in C#. The graphics were created in Photoshop. Bone information and the quiz question file are saved in JSON format. 
The 3D models for the skeleton and skull are part of the BodyParts3D suite (http://lifesciencedb.jp/bp3d/) and are available for use under the CC BY-SA 2.1 license.
